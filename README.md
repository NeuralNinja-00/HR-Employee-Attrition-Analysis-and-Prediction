# HR-Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction

**Project Description:**

This project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition in an organization using data from HR records. By leveraging logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, we seek to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and develop a model that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

**Key Steps and Analysis:**

**Data Loading and Cleaning:**

Load the dataset containing employee information.
Check for missing values, data types, and duplicates.
Remove any duplicate records to ensure data quality.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Understand the distribution and summary statistics of the data.
Visualize the relationship between various factors (like salary and department) and employee attrition using bar plots.

**Feature Engineering:**

Select relevant features for the model: satisfaction_level, average_montly_hours, promotion_last_5years, and salary.
Convert categorical variables (such as salary) into numerical format using label encoding.

**Data Splitting:
**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Train a logistic regression model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set to understand its predictive power.

**Model Deployment:
**
The trained model can be used to predict employee attrition, helping HR departments take proactive measures to retain employees.

**Outcome:**

The logistic regression model provides an accuracy score, indicating how well it can predict employee attrition based on the selected features. This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in human resource management, offering insights into factors that influence employee retention.
